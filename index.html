                    <p align="justify">A web server is a <b> software that is part of the server </b> and its main mission is to return information <b> (pages) </b> when it receives <b> petitions </b> from users.
                    For the correct functioning of a web server we need a <b> web client </b> that makes a <b> http or https </b> request
                    through a browser such as Chrome, Firefox or Safari and <b> a server </b> where the information is stored.
                    </p><br><br>

                    <p align="center"><b>Types of WEB Servers: </b> </p><br>
                    <p align = "justify"> <b> 1. Apache HTTP Server </b><br>
                    Apache  is <b> free and open source software,</b> which for years has been the most widely used software by web servers, currently rivaling Nginx.    <br>
                     It also stands out for being <b> multiplatform </b>, being compatible with operating systems such as Linux, Window, IOS, Unix, etc. <br> <br>
                    <b> 2. Nginx Server </b> <br>
                    As with Apache, we would be facing a <b> open source and multiplatform </b> software compatible with Window, IOS, Linux, etc. It has a <b> paid version in addition to the free one. </b> <br > <br>
                    This type of web server is known for its  <b> good performance when it has to manage a high number of simultaneous visits </b>, since users do not perceive a delay in loading the page even though that </b>concurrent access is occurring. </b> <br> <br>
                    It is currently the <b> most used web server software in the world. </b> <br> <br>
                    <b> 3. LiteSpeed ​​</b> <br>
                    LiteSpeed ​​was born as a <b> replacement for Apache </b>, to improve the performance of the web server <b> in high traffic environments. </b> Like Nginx, it has a free version and a paid version. <br>
                    Currently performance tests do not indicate an improvement over Nginx. <br> <br>
                     <b> 4. Microsoft IIS Server </b> <br>
                    This type of web server is developed by <b> Microsof </b> t and, in the event that Microsoft tools need to be integrated, it would be a recommended alternative due to the compatibility we would obtain. <br>
                    It runs on Windows thanks to IIS (Internet Information Services) technology and is <b> compatible with pages programmed in ASP (Active Server pages) or .NET </b>, unlike other web servers compatible with Linux. <br> <br>
                    <b> 5. Sun Java System Web Server </b> <br>
                    This type of server is intended for programmers who work with <b> Java, Python or Ruby. </b> <br>
                    It is a web server created to support a  <b> heavy workload </b> with very specific technologies such as Java.

                    <p align="justify"><span translate="no"><b>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol </b> </span> or <span translate="yes">dynamic host configuration protocol</span> is an extension of the <b> Bootstrap (BOOTP) </b> protocol. The boot protocol, known by the acronym BOOTP for Boot Strap Protocol, is a UDP network protocol used by network clients to obtain an IP address automatically. <br> <br>

                    DHCP was developed as a solution for large networks, mobile computers and laptops and therefore complements BOOTP, among other things, for its ability to <b> automatically assign <u>reusable</u> network addresses </b> and by the existence of <b> additional configuration possibilities. </b> <br> <br>

                    The configuration parameters sent by the DHCP server are not valid for an indeterminate period of time, but for a "loan" time defined by the administrator known as <b> concession or rental of addresses <span translate="no">(lease time)</span> </b>. This indicates how long a device can access the network with that address. Before it expires (after half the time), clients have to request an extension of the lease by sending a new <b> DHCP REQUEST. </b>If it don't, the <b> DHCP <span translate="no"> refresh </span></b> does not take place and the server releases it accordingly.<br> <br>

                    This network protocol is based on a <b>client-server</b> model. In this scenario, a device (a laptop, mobile, etc.) requests, when connecting to a network, the IP configuration to a DHCP server through the ports <b> UDP 67 and 68 </b> (for IPv6 , ports <b> 546 and 547 </b>), which for its part consults in a database the addresses and assignable network parameters before giving an answer. Once the query is made, the server sends the following parameters to the client through the network: <br> <br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Unique <b> IP address </b> <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <b> Subnet Mask </b> <br>

                    A DNS server, also known as a domain name system server or <span translate="no"> Domain Name System,</span> consists of <b>software for servers</b> that uses a <b>DNS database</b> to respond to requests that are related to the domain name space . As they are generally housed on dedicated hosts, the computers that host these programs are also called that.<br><br>

                    Every time a user registers a domain, a <b> WHOIS entry </b> is created in the corresponding registry and this is stored in DNS as a “resource record”. The database of a DNS server thus becomes the compilation of all the records in the zone of the domain namespace that it manages. <br> <br>

                    <b>The creation of the domain name system </b> in 1983 replaced the earlier resolution procedure, which was very error-prone and based on a <b> local hosts file. </b>  This <b> hosts.txt </b> file can still found today on UNIX-based systems in the <b> etc / </b> directory and, on Windows computers, in <b>% SystemRoot% \ system32 \ drivers \ etc. </b> <br> <br>

                    The <b> hosts.txt file required manual maintenance and regular updating, </b> an effort impossible as the Internet grew exponentially. Today, this file is used exclusively for the <b>classification of IP addresses in local networks. </b> It also allows blocking web servers by automatically redirecting their address to local hosting <span translate="no">(local host).</span> <br> <br>

                    On the other hand, a differentiation is usually made between primary and secondary DNS servers:<br><br>

                    <b> 1. Primary, Main or Master Server: </b> is a DNS server that stores the information about a certain zone of the domain namespace in its own database. <br> <br>

                    <b> 2. Secondary or Slave Server: </b> when the information of a name server does not come from its own zone files, but is second or third-hand. This situation occurs when a server cannot resolve a request with its own database and has to resort to the information available on another name server (recursive resolution). This DNS data is temporarily stored in local storage <span translate = "no"> (caching) </span> and are provided for future requests. Since the entries in the zone file itself may have changed in the meantime, information provided by secondary servers is not considered secure.

                    <p align="justify">A proxy server acts as an <b>intermediary</b> between the connections of a <b>client and a destination server</b>, filtering all packets between the two. In this way, these types of servers are used to:  <br><br>

                    &nbsp;<b>1. Firewall:</b> A firewall is a type of network security system that acts as a barrier between a network and the Internet. Security professionals configure firewalls to block unwanted access to a network, often as a countermeasure against malware or hacker attacks. A proxy server located between a trusted network and the Internet is the perfect place to install a firewall that intercepts traffic before it <b>enters</b> the network, allowing you to decide whether to approve or block it.<br><br>
                    &nbsp;<b>2. Content Filters:</b> Just as proxy servers can regulate <b>incoming connection</b> requests through a firewall, they can also act as content filters and block unwanted outgoing traffic. Companies can configure proxy servers as content filters to prevent employees from accessing blocked websites from work.<br><br>
                    &nbsp;<b>3. Security: </b> In addition to containing firewalls, proxy servers can also enhance security by <b>acting as the exclusive public face of your network</b>. Seen from the outside, all network users are anonymous, as they are hidden behind the proxy's IP address. If a hacker wants to access a specific device on a network, it will cost much more to find it.<br><br>
                    &nbsp;<b>4. Shared Internet Connections: </b> Businesses (or even homes) with a single Internet connection can use a proxy server to funnel all of their devices through it.<br>
